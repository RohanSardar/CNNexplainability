# 🧠 CNN Explainability

This repository contains implementations of popular **CNN explainability techniques** such as CAM, Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and more. The goal is to make it easy to visualize what parts of an image a convolutional neural network focuses on when making predictions.

At the moment, **only Class Activation Mapping (CAM)** is implemented.
More methods — including **Grad-CAM**, **Grad-CAM++**, **Score-CAM**, and others — will be added soon.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is **a work in progress**.
Expect frequent updates as new explainability techniques are added.

## 🖼️ Class Activation Mapping (CAM)

CAM highlights the image regions that contribute most to a model’s prediction.
